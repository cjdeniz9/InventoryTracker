# Tracker

This project was built using React and Tailwind to create a more efficient workflow and providing financial insights when keeping track of your inventory.

# Note 

For demo purpose, I permanently added the first item in your inventory to speed up the process of navigating through the site. To test out the all features, please add more items.
