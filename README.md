# Tracker

This project was built using React and Tailwind to create a more efficient workflow and provide financial insights when keeping track of your inventory.

### [Live](https://inv-tracker.netlify.app/)

# Features

  - Perform CRUD operations when using Upload.io API to manage the product's image
  - Perform CRUD operations on items in your inventory
  - Gain financial insight on your inventory's value through the dashboard with a graph and reports of the finance
  - Search, filter, and sort your items

# Note 

For demo purposes, I permanently added the first item in your inventory to speed up the process of navigating through the site. To test out all the features, please add more items.
